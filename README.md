# ShaderViewer

ShaderViewer is a C++ project designed to simplify the implementation of GLSL shaders. It includes the `ShaderUtil` class, which makes reading shaders much easier.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to make it easier to use shaders dumped from TLOZ Breath of the Wild with Render Doc. By simplifying the implementation of GLSL shaders, this project aims to make it easier to work with and understand the shaders used in the game.
